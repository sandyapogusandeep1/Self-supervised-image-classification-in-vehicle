# Self-supervised-image-classification-in-vehicle
**Abstrat**
Self-supervised deep learning approach for automated vehicle image classifi-
cation, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data in large-scale datasets.
The method combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for extracting
fine-grained local features and Transformers for capturing global image con-
text. Contrastive learning frameworks like SimCLR and MoCo are utilized to
pre-train the model on unlabeled data, enabling the learning of robust feature
representations. SimCLR employs extensive augmentations and a simplified
architecture, while MoCo incorporates a dynamic dictionary and momentum
encoder for consistent feature learning. CNNs enhance fine-detail recogni-
tion, and Transformers improve structural understanding of vehicle images.
The hybrid architecture demonstrates significant improvements in classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments affirm its scalability and applicability for
autonomous driving, traffic monitoring, and intelligent transportation systems,
reducing reliance on labeled datasets. This approach highlights the growing
potential of self-supervised learning in real-world applications.
